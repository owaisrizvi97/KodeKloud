-we first initialize the git under our project's folder.
-then we should run git init command.
-the git status shows that empty repo.
-now create a new file with name story.txt and then check status.
-it shows this:
	On branch master

		No commits yet

		Untracked files:
		  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
			.~lock.EE logs.csv#
			Devops Pre-requisite Course/
			Kubernetes Book.pdf
			Linux: Bootcamp.pdf

		nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

- Next, you need to run git add command to add your whole project into staging.
	git add ./*
	or
	git add <filename>
- Now when you run git status it shows this:
	
	On branch master

	No commits yet

	Changes to be committed:
	  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
		new file:   Devops Pre-requisite Course/Application deployment mechanism and basics (kodekloud)
		new file:   Devops Pre-requisite Course/Course Material/Introduction/Additional-Resources.pdf
		new file:   Devops Pre-requisite Course/Course Material/Introduction/DevOps-Pre-Requisites-v2.pdf
		new file:   Devops Pre-requisite Course/Database basics
		new file:   Devops Pre-requisite Course/Deployments with webservers
		new file:   Devops Pre-requisite Course/SSL & TLS basics
		new file:   Devops Pre-requisite Course/git basics
		new file:   Devops Pre-requisite Course/sample app deployment
		new file:   Git for Beginners/git init lecture
		new file:   Kubernetes Book.pdf
		new file:   Linux: Bootcamp.pdf

- Now we can simply use the git commit -m "my first commit" command to associate the commit.

- If you modified any of these file accidentaly and wish to restore the previous version of file use:
	git restore <filename>

- If you delete the file that was staged and you wish to restore it, you can use git restore command. But if you want to 
delete the commits and/or staged status from git repo, use:
		git rm <filename>
		this will permanently delete the file commits and staged status from git.
- If we create a new file and also modified the existing file, so git status would be to untracked newly added file and 
modified shows for edited file. Such as:

		On branch master
		Changes not staged for commit:
		  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
		  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
			modified:   Git for Beginners/git init lecture

		Untracked files:
		  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
			Git for Beginners/test.html

		no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
- you can now add both of the files into staged using:
	git add .
	then add commits:
	git commit -m "newly added files"
