git branch (for listing branches)
git branch <branch-name> (to create new branch only)
git checkout -b <newly created branch name> ( to create and immediately switch into it)
git checkout <branch name> (to swich into branch)
git branch -d <branch name> ( to delete branch)


git merge <branch name>

	> no fast forward >> will be done when there are commits in master branch, creates a new commit having pointed to 
	all commits in master and child branch perfectly.
